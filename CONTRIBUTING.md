Please follow these guidelines when contributing to the project:

- Follow the [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) guidelines.
- Follow the [Go Doc Comments](https://go.dev/doc/comment) guidelines.
- Follow the principles of clean code as outlined in
  Robert C. Martin's "[Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)" book.
- Write tests/benchmarks for new code or changes to existing code, and make sure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

### Makefile Targets

<!-- TODO -->

### Error and Log Messages

Error and log messages should not start with a capital letter (unless it's a proper noun or acronym) and
should not end with punctuation.

#### Examples

- Correct ✅: "unable to connect to client"
- Incorrect ❌: "Unable to connect to client"
- Incorrect ❌: "unable to connect to client."

### Testing

All changes on core must contain proper and well-defined unit-tests, also previous tests must be passed as well.
This codebase used `testify` for unit tests, make sure you follow these guide for tests:

- For panic cases make sure you use `assert.Panics`
- For checking err using `assert.ErrorIs` make sure you pass expected error as second argument.
- For checking equality using `assert.Equal` make sure you pass expected value as the first argument.

### Benchmarking

Make sure you follow [this guide](https://100go.co/89-benchmarks) when you write or change benchmarks to reach an accurate result.

### Help Messages

Follow these rules for help messages for CLI commands and flags:

- Help string should not start with a capital letter.
- Help string should not end with punctuation.
- Don't include default value in the help string.
- Include the acceptable range for the flags that accept a range of values.

## Commit Guidelines

Please follow these rules when committing changes to the Immortal:

- Each commit should represent a single, atomic change to the codebase.
  Avoid making multiple unrelated changes in a single commit.
- Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format for commit messages and
  Pull Request titles.

### Commit type

List of conventional commit [types](https://github.com/commitizen/conventional-commit-types/blob/master/index.json):

| Types    | Description                                                                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| fix      | A big fix                                                                         |
| feat     | A new feature                                                                     |
| docs     | Documentation only changes                                                        |
| test     | Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests                                 |
| build    | Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies                     |
| ci       | Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts                                 |
| perf     | A code change that improves performance                                           |
| refactor | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature                         |
| style    | Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc) |
| chore    | Other changes that don't modify src or test files                                 |

### Commit Scope

The scope helps specify which part of the code is affected by your commit.
It must be included in the commit message to provide clarity.
Multiple scopes can be used if the changes impact several areas.

### Commit Description

- Keep the commit message under 50 characters.
- Start the commit message with a lowercase letter and do not end with punctuation.
- Write commit messages in the imperative: "fix bug" not "fixed bug" or "fixes bug".

### Examples

  - Correct ✅: "feat(ws): close stale connections"
  - Correct ✅: "feat(ws, config): max_wss connection limit"
  - Incorrect ❌: 'feat(config): Blacklist npubs."
  - Incorrect ❌: 'feat(config): blacklisted npubs"
